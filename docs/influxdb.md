# Importing results from InfluxDB 3

Otava imports query results from InfluxDB 3 Core or Enterprise through the
[`influxdb3-python`](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb3/core/reference/client-libraries/v3/python/)
client. SQL is the default query language; set `query_language: influxql` for
InfluxQL queries.

## Connection

```yaml
influxdb:
  host: http://localhost:8181
  database: performance
  token: ${INFLUXDB_TOKEN}
```

The same settings are available through `INFLUXDB_HOST`, `INFLUXDB_DATABASE`,
and `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`, or the `--influxdb-host`, `--influxdb-database`, and
`--influxdb-token` command-line options. Command-line values take precedence
over environment variables, which take precedence over YAML.

## Reproducible example

The bundled example starts InfluxDB 3 Core with authenticated, in-memory
storage, seeds deterministic latency data, and runs Otava against it:

```bash
docker build -t apache/otava:latest .
docker compose -f examples/influxdb/docker-compose.yaml run --rm otava \
  analyze api_latency_sql --branch main --since 2025-01-01
docker compose -f examples/influxdb/docker-compose.yaml down
```

Run `api_latency_influxql` instead to query the same data with InfluxQL.

The admin token committed under `examples/influxdb/` is a fixed test
credential, and the server discards its in-memory data when stopped. Both are
for this local demonstration only. Use a securely generated token and durable
object storage for production deployments.

## Test configuration

```yaml
tests:
  api_latency_sql:
    type: influxdb
    query_language: sql
    query: |
      SELECT time, branch, p95_ms, commit
      FROM api_latency
      WHERE branch = %{BRANCH}
      ORDER BY time
    time_column: time
    attributes: [branch, commit]
    metrics:
      p95:
        column: p95_ms
        direction: -1
        scale: 1

  legacy_api_latency:
    type: influxdb
    query_language: influxql
    query: SELECT time, branch, p95_ms FROM api_latency WHERE branch = %{BRANCH}
    attributes: [branch]
    metrics: [p95_ms]
```

Metric definitions use `column`, `direction`, and `scale` as with the other
SQL-backed importers. `%{BRANCH}` is replaced with an escaped string literal
when `--branch` is supplied.

Run the analysis with:

```bash
otava analyze api_latency_sql --branch main --last 100
```

InfluxDB is import-only in this release; Otava does not write change points
back to InfluxDB.
